JobUpScraper
============

A tool to grab lists of jobs from JobUp.ch and put them into a form that is useful. The main
motivation for this is the limited info provided by the JobMailers which insist on only listing
a maximum of 10 new positions in each email notification: not much help when there might be 60
or more posts.

This is my attempt at over-engineering something which is intrinsically very easy - for fun!
