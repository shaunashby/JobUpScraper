# JobUpScraper

A tool for scraping job sites and massaging results into usable form.

## About

JobUpScraper is a tool to grab a list of job announcements from [JobUp](http://www.jobup.ch) and put them 
into a form that is useful. The main motivation for this is the limited info provided by the user-configurable 
`JobMailers` which insist on only listing a maximum of 10 new positions in each email notification: not much 
help when there might be 60 or more posts to skim over.

This is my attempt at over-engineering something which is intrinsically very easy - for fun!

### How to use it

Run `job_scraper -h` for usage information.
